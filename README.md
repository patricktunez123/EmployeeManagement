## How to set up and test this app

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

To install this project on your local machine, you need first to clone the repository ```https://github.com/patricktunez123/EmployeeManagement.git``` or download the zip file and once this is set up you are going to need NODEJS ([Node Package Installer - NPM]) and Postgresql as well as Postman installed on your machine.

## Installing

The installation of this application is fairly straightforward, After cloning this repository to your local machine, cd into it using your terminal and run the following command

- npm install

It will install the node_modules which will help you run this project on your local machine.

## Set environment variables

After successfully installed all packages the next step is to set up environment variables, in root folder create a file and call it .env and open this file in any text editor of your choice then paste the following into it (Do not forget to edit it accordingly):

- PORT=PUT ANY PORT OF YOUR CHOICE HERE
- JWT_KEY=jwtKey
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://someuser:somepassword@somehost:5432/somedatabase
- NODE_ENV='development'

## Create Database

Open postges that we have installed earlier (Checkout Prerequisites above), and then create a database and call it employee_management.

## Run the server

- npm run devStart

cd into project directory and by using terminal, run the above command (npm run devStart) it will start your server and then you will be able to test endpoints in Postman

## Test Swagger Docs locally

After runnig the server, open browser and type 'http://localhost:5000/docs/' in the url.
NOTE: Note that i have used 5000 after http://localhost: , this is the PORT that my server is running on so you too have to use the PORT that you have specified in .env file, remember?
